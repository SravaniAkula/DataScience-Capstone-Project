# DataScience-Capstone-Project

This is the Capstone project for the Coursera Data Science specialization, which involved developing a word predicting application in R/Shiny. We were provided a Corpus of Text from Blogs, Twitter and News from HC Corpora which is a collection of corpora for various languages freely available to download. However we were required to use only The English texts.
This project is conducted with the support of the Johns Hopkins University and in cooperation with SwiftKey.
